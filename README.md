# Inventory Management System (IMS) - Backend

A robust and scalable backend API for managing product inventory, suppliers, purchase orders, and warehouse operations. Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) for high performance, this project is designed for learning and practical implementation of advanced backend concepts such as RBAC, interceptors, testing, and modular architecture.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** enables small to mid-sized businesses to efficiently track, manage, and optimize their inventory processes. The primary goal is to reduce errors, automate stock tracking, and provide actionable insights to streamline business operations.

**Key Features:**
- Product and category management (CRUD)
- Real-time inventory tracking with history/audit trail
- Multi-location stock management
- Supplier and purchase order management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Secure authentication & authorization (JWT)
- Modular, extensible backend architecture

---

## üéØ Business Goal & Objectives

- **Optimize Inventory Levels**: Prevent overstocking and stockouts
- **Streamline Operations**: Automate repetitive inventory processes
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Actionable analytics for purchasing and stock management
- **Reduce Manual Errors**: Digitize and centralize inventory tracking
- **Enhance Security & Accountability**: Role-based permissions and audit logs

---

## üèóÔ∏è MVP Scope

- User authentication (JWT)
- RBAC: Admin, Inventory Manager, Warehouse Staff, Purchasing Agent, Readonly
- Product & category endpoints
- Inventory transactions and stock adjustments
- Supplier CRUD and purchase order endpoints
- Basic reporting (stock levels, reorder recommendations)
- Unit and integration testing
